          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
            accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with
            poorly designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both
            developers and users). This often comes down to a lack of
            understanding around different user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn't be too
            difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an
            'easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
          </p>

            Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can
            check these criteria off the list!

          <h2>Handy tips on how to create accessible websites for everyone</h2>
          <p>
            With a 142 html elements, it can be confusing which to use where.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with practice you will discover a dozen or so that easily
            lend themselves to replacing the ubiquitous div.

          <h2>Accessibility Checks:</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Heading elements & Page Titles:</dt>
            <dd>
              HTML heading elements have been used to represent page structure,
              supporting assistive technologies that allow page navigation from
              heading to heading
            </dd>

            <dt>Re-size Text:</dt>
            <dd>
              You can vaary text size by using yur browser's text resizing
              settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom, page
              zoom (which also zooms images) without incurring styling issues /
              text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
            </dd>

            <dt>Alternative text for images:</dt>
            <dd>All images have been given appropriate alternative text.</dd>

            <dt>Link text:</dt>
            <dd>
              All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context, and
              hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text style from
              normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it has
              been labelled as doing so.
            </dd>

            <dt>JavaScript Independence:</dt>
            <dd>
              Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for navigation or
              functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put in place in
              case your browser does not support these scripts.
            </dd>

            <dt>Colour contrast:</dt>
            <dd>
              has been checked for text and background colour combinations to
              ensure that the contrast is sufficient and that any information is
              not referenced solely by colour.
            </dd>

            <dt>Style sheets:</dt>
            <dd>
              If style sheets are not supported or are turned off, information
              on the site can still be accessed and read.
            </dd>

            <dt>Forms:</dt>
            <dd>
              Forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them
              using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form
              labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and
              making it easier to select small radio buttons or checkboxes.
